TO DO 
# Add submission api for employees [done]

changes required
# pushed firebase.js - remove it.
# The meal should expire or delete after deadline so that new meals can be added 
# Consider working on a weekly meal like for mondays same meal , tuesday same meal , so that admin dosent 
have to always assign the meals everyday and just look at the polling status.
# display the meals added for the admin so that he can  delete or  edit the meals, 
# If there is an option to edit the deadline then 
    1. auto submit function should not just check for isExpired status it should recheck
     deadline for changes and update the isExpired status to show the updated timeline.
